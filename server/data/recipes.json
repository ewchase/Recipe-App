Return to the bowl.\nStir in self-rising flour with a rubber spatula. When it starts to look crumbly, use your hands to knead and press the dough together. It will be very sticky, which is normal. Keep kneading until it forms a ball of dough.\nClean your hands, oil them with avocado oil, and rub some oil on your work surface and all around the dough.\nDivide the dough into balls - they don't have to be perfect, but roughly the same size - about the size of a golf ball. Set aside.\nRoll each dough ball into the cinnamon sugar prepared before.\nPlace the dough balls in the prepared loaf pan. Arrange them next to each other to form a first layer, then stack them up in the pan until all the balls are in the pan.\nIn another bowl, stir the coconut sugar and avocado oil. The mixture will resemble a slightly liquid paste.\nDrizzle this paste on top of the bread and in the holes between the dough balls so it runs down the pan and forms a caramel layer when baking.\nIf you like, add banana slices on top of the bread.\nBake on the center rack of the oven for 35 minutes at 350 Â°F (180 Â°C) until golden brown and puffy.\nFlip the bread upside down on a wooden board and let it cool down to room temperature.\nServe plain or with a drizzle of vegan royal icing.",

If too wet, sprinkle more flour.\nGrease your hand with coconut oil, grab about a tablespoon of dough, roll it into a ball, and place it on a plate covered with parchment paper.
